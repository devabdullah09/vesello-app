# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Database Migration Required

## The Problem

New events are only showing 3 sections (Hero, Timeline, Ceremony) instead of all 11 sections because the database is missing the required columns.

## The Solution

You MUST run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor immediately:

```sql
-- Add section_visibility column
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS section_visibility JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;

-- Add section_content column
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS section_content JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;

-- Add comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN events.section_visibility IS 'Controls which sections are visible on the event website';
COMMENT ON COLUMN events.section_content IS 'Contains the content for all sections of the event website';

-- Update existing events with default section visibility (all sections visible)
UPDATE events
SET section_visibility = '{
    "heroSection": true,
    "timelineSection": true,
    "ceremonySection": true,
    "ceremonyVenueSection": true,
    "seatingChartSection": true,
    "menuSection": true,
    "wishesAndGiftsSection": true,
    "teamSection": true,
    "accommodationSection": true,
    "transportationSection": true,
    "additionalInfoSection": true
}'::jsonb
WHERE section_visibility = '{}'::jsonb OR section_visibility IS NULL;

-- Update existing events with default section content
UPDATE events
SET section_content = '{
    "heroSection": {
        "coupleNames": "",
        "eventDate": "",
        "venue": "",
        "backgroundImage": "",
        "customMessage": "WE'\''RE GETTING MARRIED!"
    },

-- Update section_content with actual event data where available
UPDATE events
SET section_content = jsonb_set(
    jsonb_set(
        jsonb_set(
            section_content,
            '{heroSection,coupleNames}',
            to_jsonb(couple_names)

    '{heroSection,venue}',
    to_jsonb(venue)
)
WHERE couple_names IS NOT NULL OR event_date IS NOT NULL OR venue IS NOT NULL;

-- Update ceremony section with actual event data
UPDATE events
SET section_content = jsonb_set(
    jsonb_set(
        jsonb_set(
            section_content,
            '{ceremonySection,date}',
            to_jsonb(event_date::text)
        ),
        '{ceremonySection,location}',
        to_jsonb(venue)
    ),
    '{ceremonyVenueSection,venueName}',
    to_jsonb(venue)

WHERE event_date IS NOT NULL OR venue IS NOT NULL;

-- Success message
SELECT 'Database migration completed successfully! All events now have proper section data.' as message;
```

## How to Run

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire SQL above**
4. **Click "Run"**

## What This Does

- âœ… Adds the missing `section_visibility` column
- âœ… Adds the missing `section_content` column
- âœ… Sets all sections to visible by default
- âœ… Populates all sections with default content
- âœ… Updates existing events with proper data
- âœ… Merges actual event data (couple names, dates, venues) into sections

## After Running This

- âœ… **All 11 sections will show** for new events
- âœ… **Edit functionality will work** for all sections
- âœ… **Existing events will be updated** with proper data
- âœ… **Content editor will work** properly

## Why This Happened

The code was updated to handle the new database structure, but the database itself wasn't updated. The missing columns cause the API to return `undefined` for section data, which breaks the section rendering logic.

**This migration will fix everything!** ðŸŽ‰
